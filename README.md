# Sum of Sales (Data URI CSV) â€” Single-Page Web App

A production-ready, static single-page application that decodes an embedded CSV (via data URI), parses it, sums the `sales` column, and displays the total in the `#total-sales` element. Built with Bootstrap 5 and works on GitHub Pages without any backend.

## Features
- Parses embedded CSV from a data URI (no external requests required)
- Sums the `sales` column and displays the result in `#total-sales`
- Clean, responsive UI built with Bootstrap 5
- Dataset preview table rendered on the page
- Robust error handling and graceful fallbacks
- Fully static: suitable for GitHub Pages

## Getting Started
- No build step or server required.
- Simply open `index.html` in any modern browser.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html`.
2. The app will decode the embedded CSV, parse it, and compute the sum of the `sales` column.
3. The computed total appears in the `Total Sales` card (element ID: `#total-sales`).
4. The dataset preview is shown in the table on the right.

## Technical Overview
- Libraries:
  - Bootstrap 5 (CSS/JS) via CDN
- Attachments:
  - `data.csv` is embedded as a data URI inside the JavaScript. The app decodes base64 with `atob`, parses the CSV, and computes totals.
- Code Structure:
  - All code is contained within `index.html`:
    - Inline CSS in `<style>`
    - Inline JavaScript in `<script>`
    - Constants for data URIs
    - Functions: `decodeBase64DataUri`, `parseCsvAndSum`, `renderTable`, `showError`
- Error Handling:
  - If parsing fails, a visible alert is shown and `#total-sales` falls back to `0`.

## Deployment
- This project is fully static and works on GitHub Pages.
- You can host it by uploading the files to any static host or by using GitHub Pages.
- For local use, just open `index.html` directly in your browser.
